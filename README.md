# E-commerce Search Approaches

This project explores various search technologies, including Full-Text Search, ElasticSearch, and Redis-Stack JSON Document Search, to enhance search functionality in an E-commerce application.

This repository contains code samples and configurations demonstrating the implementation of different search approaches within an E-commerce application.

## Search Stacks

### Full-Text Search

The Full-Text Search approach utilizes MySQL's full-text search capabilities to perform efficient and accurate searches across product descriptions, names, and other relevant attributes. This approach leverages MySQL's built-in indexing and search algorithms to deliver relevant search results to users.

## ElasticSearch

ElasticSearch is a powerful and scalable search engine that provides advanced search capabilities, including full-text search, filtering, and aggregation. In this approach, we integrate ElasticSearch with our E-commerce application to offload search queries from the database and leverage ElasticSearch's distributed architecture for improved performance and scalability.

## Redis-Stack JSON Document Search

Redis-Stack JSON Document Search utilizes Redis as a secondary database to store and index product data in JSON format. This approach allows us to perform fast and flexible searches using Redis' data structures and indexing capabilities. By storing product data as JSON documents in Redis, we can efficiently retrieve and filter search results without the need for complex SQL queries.
